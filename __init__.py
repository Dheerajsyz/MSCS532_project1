"""
MSCS532 Data Structures Project - Social Network Analysis

Complete implementation of data structures for identifying influential users 
in Twitter-like social network platforms.

Phase 1 Design: Social Network Analysis: Identifying Influential Users
Phase 2: Proof of concept implementation with core functionality
Phase 3: Optimized implementation with enhanced performance and scalability

Data Structures Implemented:
- Hash Table: Fast O(1) user lookups with collision handling
- Directed Graph: Follow relationships with BFS/DFS/shortest path
- Priority Queue: Heap-based influence ranking
- AVL Tree: Self-balancing BST solving recursion limits
- Performance Profiling: Comprehensive scaling analysis
